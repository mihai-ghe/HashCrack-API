#HashCrack-API
An API made to make storing, cracking and accessing your hashes easier at a distance. This app was made for people working in the field with a CrackStation at home. This app is by no means finished, lacking advanced options for the JTR commands that are run server-side and probably more features that I haven't thought about. If you have any suggestions I'd love to hear them!
